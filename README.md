Research Title: Using deep transfer learning to reduce health care inequities between ethnic groups
===================================================================================================================

**Abstract:** In biomedical research, artificial intelligence is now frequently applied. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being utilized in medicine to help with automated consultations and clinical judgments. The development of high-quality AI models depends on a large amount of standardized data, and the data skewing among races is becoming one of the most important factors affecting the intelligence of AI models at present. According to recent statistics, about 91 percent of the samples collected by the Cancer Genomics Research Project were Caucasian, followed by 6 percent of Asians, and others1. Data distribution biases can affect the predictive accuracy and robustness of AI models, and have profound negative implications on clinical decisions for statistically disadvantaged populations. Therefore, a new machine learning approach to overcome data inequities between ethnic groups is necessary.
